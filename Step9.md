### Step 9: Manual Testing

**Objective**: Regularly run your Python program and manually test each feature to ensure it works as expected. Identify and fix any bugs or issues you find to improve the functionality and reliability of your application.

#### **Instructions**:

1. **Open Your `main.py` File**:
   - Navigate to the "ELATT_Coursework" folder.
   - Open `main.py` in your text editor.

2. **Prepare Test Cases**:
   - Before running your program, think about different test cases for each feature. This includes normal cases, edge cases, and incorrect inputs.
   - Example Test Cases:
     - For menu options: valid inputs, invalid inputs, boundary values.
     - For file operations: reading existing files, handling non-existent files, testing file content changes.

3. **Running the Program**:
   - Save any changes you’ve made to `main.py`.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the "ELATT_Coursework" folder.
   - Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

4. **Testing Each Feature**:
   - Go through each menu option and perform the corresponding actions.
   - Pay attention to how the program responds, especially to incorrect or unexpected inputs.
   - Test the CRUD operations by adding, reading, updating, and deleting data in your CSV files.

5. **Recording Observations**:
   - Take notes of any issues, unexpected behaviors, or errors you encounter.
   - Note down how the program handles incorrect inputs or operations, like entering a letter instead of a number in the menu.

6. **Addressing Issues**:
   - Go back to your code to address any problems you've identified.
   - Make necessary corrections or improvements.
   - After making changes, run the program again to ensure the issues are resolved.

7. **Repeat Testing Process**:
   - Continue testing and refining until your program runs smoothly and handles all test cases as expected.

#### **Tips**:

- **Methodical Approach**: Test one feature at a time, and don’t move on to the next until you're satisfied with its performance.
- **User Perspective**: Try to think like a user who is not familiar with the program. This helps in identifying usability issues.
- **Documentation**: Keep a record of your tests and any issues you find. This documentation can be useful for future reference or if you're working with others.

#### **Visual Aid**:
- Screenshots or a video of the testing process, including both successful operations and handling of errors, can provide a practical example of manual testing.

Manual testing is a crucial part of software development, especially in the early stages. It allows you to experience your application from the user's perspective and catch issues that might not be immediately apparent. This step is designed to guide you through a thorough testing process, ensuring that each part of your program functions correctly and is user-friendly.
