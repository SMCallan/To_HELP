### Step 1: Create a Project Folder

**Objective**: To create a folder on your computer's desktop where you will store all files related to your project, "ELATT_Coursework".

#### **Instructions**:

1. **Locate the Desktop**:
   - Find the desktop area on your computer. This is usually the first screen you see after turning on the computer and logging in.

2. **Open the Context Menu**:
   - **Right-Click on the Desktop**:
     - If you are using a mouse, move the cursor to an empty area on the desktop and press the right button on the mouse.
     - If you are using a trackpad (like on a laptop), you might need to tap with two fingers or use a designated right-click area.

3. **Create a New Folder**:
   - In the menu that appears after right-clicking, look for an option that says “New” or something similar. 
   - Hover over or click on “New” to open another submenu.
   - Select “Folder” from this submenu. This will create a new folder on your desktop.

4. **Name the Folder**:
   - Right after the folder is created, its name will be highlighted.
   - Type “ELATT_Coursework” to give the folder this name.
   - Press the Enter key on your keyboard to confirm the name.

5. **Verify the Folder Creation**:
   - You should now see a new folder named “ELATT_Coursework” on your desktop.
   - If you do not see it, try the steps again or check if the folder was created in a different location.

#### **Tips**:

- **Folder Location**: Make sure you are on the Desktop when creating the folder. If you accidentally create it somewhere else, you can drag it to the Desktop.
- **Folder Name**: Ensure you spell “ELATT_Coursework” correctly to avoid confusion later.

#### **Visual Aid**:
- If possible, use screenshots or video clips showing these steps on a computer to make it easier for students to follow along.
