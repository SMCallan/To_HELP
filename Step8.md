### Step 8: Comments and Documentation

**Objective**: Add comments and documentation to your Python code in `main.py`. This practice is essential for explaining the purpose and functionality of your code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

#### **Instructions**:

1. **Open Your `main.py` File**:
   - Go to the "ELATT_Coursework" folder.
   - Open `main.py` in your text editor.

2. **Adding Comments to Explain Code**:
   - Insert comments throughout your code to explain what specific sections or lines do.
   - Use the `#` symbol to start a comment. Everything following `#` on the same line is a comment.
   - Example:
     ```python
     # Function to display menu options
     def show_menu():
         print("1. Search Departments")
         # More menu options...
     ```

3. **Documenting Functions**:
   - Write a brief comment above each function explaining what the function does, its parameters, and what it returns (if applicable).
   - Example:
     ```python
     # Read and display the contents of a CSV file
     def read_csv_file(filename):
         # Function implementation...
     ```

4. **Comments for Clarity**:
   - Add comments before complex or non-obvious parts of your code to clarify their purpose.
   - For any workarounds or important decisions, explain why you chose that approach.

5. **Updating Comments**:
   - As you modify your code, remember to update your comments so they stay relevant and accurate.

6. **Avoid Over-Commenting**:
   - Comment important and complex parts of the code. However, avoid adding comments to every single line as it can clutter your code.

7. **Review Your Comments**:
   - After adding comments, review your code to ensure the comments are clear and helpful.

#### **Tips**:

- **Descriptive Language**: Use clear and descriptive language in your comments for easy understanding.
- **Consistency**: Be consistent in your commenting style throughout the code.
- **Function Headers**: For functions, consider including information about the purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions that might be raised.

#### **Visual Aid**:
- A screenshot showing an example of well-commented code sections can be helpful, especially for students who are new to programming.

In this step, you're focusing on making your code readable and maintainable through effective commenting and documentation. This is a key skill in programming, as it not only helps others understand your code but also aids you in keeping track of your own work, especially for larger or more complex projects. The instructions are designed to guide you in creating useful and informative comments.
