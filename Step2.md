### Step 2: Set Up Your Python File

**Objective**: To create a Python file named `main.py` inside your project folder "ELATT_Coursework". This file will be the main file where you write your Python code for the project.

#### **Instructions**:

1. **Open the Project Folder**:
   - Locate the "ELATT_Coursework" folder on your desktop.
   - Double-click on the folder to open it.

2. **Open a Text Editor**:
   - You need a text editor to write Python code. You can use any basic text editor like Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), or a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text.
   - Open the text editor of your choice.

3. **Create a New File in the Text Editor**:
   - In the text editor, start a new file.
   - Usually, this can be done by clicking on “File” in the menu bar, then selecting “New”.

4. **Save the File as `main.py`**:
   - Now, save this new file in the "ELATT_Coursework" folder.
   - Click on “File” in the menu bar of the text editor, then select “Save As”.
   - In the save dialog, navigate to the "ELATT_Coursework" folder on your desktop.
   - In the 'file name' field, type `main.py`.
   - Make sure the file type is set to 'Python Files' or 'All Files' if there's an option. Some text editors might add `.txt` by default, so remove that if it appears.
   - Click “Save” to save your file.

5. **Verify File Creation**:
   - Go back to the "ELATT_Coursework" folder and check if `main.py` is there.
   - The file should have a Python icon (a snake or something similar) or just be a plain text file, depending on your computer settings.

#### **Tips**:

- **Text Editor**: If you don’t have a preferred text editor, Visual Studio Code is a good free option that works well for Python.
- **File Extension**: Ensure that the file is saved with the `.py` extension, which is used for Python files.
- **Opening the File**: You can open `main.py` anytime by double-clicking it, which should open it in your text editor.

#### **Visual Aid**:
- Including screenshots showing how to save a file in a text editor, and what the `main.py` file looks like in the "ELATT_Coursework" folder, would be very helpful.
