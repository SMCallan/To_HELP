# Ten Step Plan

### 1. **Create a Project Folder**

- **On the Desktop**: Create a folder named "ELATT_Coursework". This will be where all your project files reside.

### 2. **Set Up Your Python File**

- **Main Python File**: Inside your project folder, create a file named `main.py`. This will be the entry point of your application.

### 3. **Basic File Operations**

- **CSV File Handling**: Learn and implement basic operations to read from and write to CSV files. Python's built-in `csv` module will be sufficient for this.

### 4. **Implementing the Menu System**

- **Simple Console Menu**: In `main.py`, create a function that prints out menu options to the console. For example, options to search departments, display departments, search employees, display employee details, etc.
- **User Input**: Use the `input()` function to allow the user to select an option from the menu.

### 5. **CRUD Operations for Departments and Employees**

- **Create Functions**: Write functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting information in your CSV files. Keep these functions as simple as possible.
- **Integrate Functions with Menu**: Call these functions based on the userâ€™s menu selection.

### 6. **Basic Functionality for Searching and Displaying Data**

- **Search and Display Departments/Employees**: Implement features to search for specific departments or employees and display relevant information.

### 7. **Error Handling**

- **Basic Error Checks**: Include simple error checks to handle common scenarios like entering an invalid menu option or issues with reading/writing files.

### 8. **Comments and Documentation**

- **Code Comments**: Add comments to your code to explain what each part does. This is crucial for understanding and maintaining your code.
- **Documenting Functions**: Write brief comments above each function explaining what it does.

### 9. **Manual Testing**

- **Run and Test**: Regularly run your program and manually test each feature to make sure it works as expected. Address any bugs or issues you find.

### 10. **Refinement**

- **Iterate and Improve**: Based on your testing, refine and improve the code. Simplify any complex parts and make sure everything works smoothly.

### Conclusion

This guide focuses on the essentials, keeping the complexity low while ensuring you learn and apply key programming concepts. The aim is to create a functional, user-friendly application that meets your project requirements without overwhelming you with advanced techniques or tools.
